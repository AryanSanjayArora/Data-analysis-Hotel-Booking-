# Data-analysis-Hotel-Booking-

City and resort hotels have been facing high cancellation rates, leading to decreased revenues and inefficient room utilization. This project focuses on analyzing booking data to uncover the key factors contributing to cancellations. Using Python, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Pandas, we provide visual insights and actionable recommendations to help hotels reduce cancellation rates, optimize room usage, and boost revenue generation.
